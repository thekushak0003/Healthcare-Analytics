## üìñ Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data science application designed to predict the 30-day readmission risk for diabetic patients. The goal is to provide a tool that can help clinicians identify high-risk patients and implement targeted post-discharge care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

The application is built upon a machine learning model trained on the "Diabetes 130-US Hospitals" dataset, which contains over 100,000 patient encounters. It showcases a complete data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to model training, interpretation, and deployment as an interactive web application.

This project embodies my motto: "**Converting raw data into valuable insights.**"

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes a powerful `XGBoost` classifier to predict the likelihood of readmission.
* **Real-time Risk Scoring:** A user-friendly interface allows for the input of patient data to get an immediate risk score.
* **Model Interpretability:** Integrates `SHAP` (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide transparent, feature-level explanations for every prediction, showing *why* the model made a certain decision.
* **Interactive UI:** Built with `Streamlit` for a seamless and responsive user experience.
